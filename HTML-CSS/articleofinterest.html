        <h2>And Just What is a lens?</h2>
        <p>
          A lens is a curved surface that refracts light with the purpose of
          bringing the light to a focal point. Forms of lenses have been around
          since at least the age of Ancient Egyptians - 600BC!

        <h2>Microscopes</h2>
        <p>
          A microscope allows you to see things that are VERY, VERY small. Some
          microscopoes, called optical microscopes, use lenses to focus light
          into your eye to form an enlarged version of the thiny thing at which
          you look.

        <h2>Telescopes</h2>
        <p>
          A telescope allows you to see things taht are FAR, FAR away. Some
          telescopes use lenses to pull light together to form the image of the
          faraway object. Other telescopes use mirrors to accomplish the same
          task.
